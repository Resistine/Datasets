# Datasets
The list of consolidated SIEM/XDR datasets:

### Cyber-security Datasets - Kaggle
A collection of public datasets of cyberthreats. \
The collection is classified into categories according to the source of the relevant information, such as network traffic datasets, host based datasets, malware or fraud reports, or a special section for datasets that cannot be categorized according to a specific source. \

### SecRepo.com - Samples of Security Related Data
Finding samples of various types of Security related can be a giant pain. This is my attempt to keep a somewhat curated list of Security related data I've found, created, or was pointed to. If you perform any kind of analysis with any of this data please let me know and I'd be happy to link it from here or host it here. Hopefully by looking at others research and analysis it will inspire people to add-on, improve, and create new ideas. \

### Awesome-Cybersecurity-Datasets
A curated list of amazingly awesome Cybersecurity datasets on GitHub. Its only disadvantage is that it contains no endpoint logs etc. \

### VizSec Data Sets
VizSec started in 2004 as the Workshop on Visualization and Data Mining for Computer Security at ACM CCS. After that first event, the event got bigger and bigger each year as it rotated between a visualization-focused conference and a security-focused conference. \
Here is a list of potentially useful data sets for the VizSec research and development community. \

## Network Datasets
We don't consider network-only datasets as IDS/NDR/NetFlow. However, we put them here because they are friends and they will surely acquire more information soon :)

### Public PCAP files for download - Netresec
NETRESEC AB is an independent software vendor (ISV) with focus on network security monitoring and network forensics. The datasets include various Pcap files as Research PCAP datasets from FOI's Information Warfare Lab (FOI is The Swedish Defence Research Agency) Technical challenges used by Sweden's National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) for recruitment. Includes several PCAP challenges. \

### The Stratosphere IPS project 
The Czech Technical University datasets offers valuable datasets for security research, including the CTU-13 dataset. This dataset contains 13 malware captures, each labeled on a flow-by-flow basis. Researchers can access it under the Creative Commons CC-BY license for enhancing intrusion detection and malware analysis models. \
